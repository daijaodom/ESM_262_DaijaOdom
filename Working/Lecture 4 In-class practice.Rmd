```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
# Task 1: Use a for loop to compute the total yield after 10 years 
# Fertilizer is normally distributed with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 0.5
fertilizer_app = rnorm(n= 10, mean = 5, sd = 0.5)
# TP (mean precipitation) is 20 cm
TP = 20
# Make a table 
crop = data.frame(fertilizer_app = fertilizer_app)
# Create a for loop to compute the total yield after 10 years
# year is the counter (similar to using i)
for (year in 1:10){
  
}
```


Create a function
```{r}
# Task 2: Create a function that takes as input a single value for annual fertilizer and annual total precipation and returns yield.
fertilizer

```


Practice error checking
